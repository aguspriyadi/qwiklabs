# Build and Secure Networks in Google Cloud: Challenge Lab 
# https://www.qwiklabs.com/focuses/12068?parent=catalog

# Task 1: Remove the overly permissive rules
    - Go to VPC Network > Firewall > Delete open-access rule (Checks its box and Click Delete)
    # gcloud compute firewall-rules delete open-access

# Task 2: Start the bastion host instance
    - Go to Compute Engine > VM instance
        - You will see bastion isntance with stopped condition, start it (Checks its box and Click Start/Resume)
    # Go to Compute Engine and start Bastion instance.

# Task 3: Create a firewall rule that allows SSH (tcp/22) from the IAP service and add network tag on bastion
    - In VM instances, Click bastion instance
        - Click Edit > Add bastion to the Network tags
        - SAVE
    - Back to Firewall rule page > Create firewall rule with configuration:
        - Name: allow-ssh-from-iap
        - Network: acme-vpc
        - Target tags: bastion
        - Source IP ranges: 35.235.240.0/20
        - Protocols and ports: Check TCP and input 22 (to allow SSH)
    # gcloud compute firewall-rules create ssh-ingress --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 35.235.240.0/20 --target-tags [NETWORK TAG-1] --network acme-vpc
    # gcloud compute instances add-tags bastion --tags=[NETWORK TAG-1] --zone=us-central1-b

# Task 4: Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on HTTP (tcp/80) to any address and add network tag on juice-shop
    - In VM instances, Click juice-shop instance
        - Click Edit > Add juice-shop to the Network tags
        - SAVE
    - In Firewall rule > Create second firewall rule with configuration:
        - Name: allow-http-ingress
        - Network: acme-vpc
        - Target tags: juice-shop
        - Source IP ranges: 0.0.0.0/0
        - Protocols and ports: Check TCP and input 80 (to allow HTTP)
     # gcloud compute firewall-rules create http-ingress --allow=tcp:80 --source-ranges 0.0.0.0/0 --target-tags [NETWORK TAG-2] --network acme-vpc
     # gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=[NETWORK TAG-2] --zone=us-central1-b

# Task 5: Create a firewall rule that allows traffic on SSH (tcp/22) from acme-mgmt-subnet network address and add network tag on juice-shop
    - In Firewall rule > Create third firewall rule with configuration:
        - Name: allow-ssh-from-mgmt-subnet
        - Network: acme-vpc
        - Target tags: bastion and juice-shop
        - Source IP ranges: <IP address range of your acme-mgmt-subnet>
            # Note: go to VPC network and have a look to IP address ranges of acme-mgmt-subnet
        - Protocols and ports: Select TCP and enter 22 (to allow SSH)
        
    # gcloud compute firewall-rules create internal-ssh-ingress --allow=tcp:22 --source-ranges 192.168.10.0/24 --target-tags [NETWORK TAG-3] --network acme-vpc
    # gcloud compute instances add-tags juice-shop --tags=[NETWORK TAG-3] --zone=us-central1-b


# Task 6: SSH to bastion host via IAP and juice-shop via bastion 
    - Go to Compute Engine > VM instances 
    - Copy juice-shop Internal IP
    - SSH on bastion instance
        - *in ssh window
            - run: ssh <juice-shop Internal IP>
    
    # ssh [Internal IP address of juice-shop]
